# Web_App-Python_Flask_HTML_CSS
This is a backup of files in the web application I developed as part of my previous project in one of my subjects. 

This was based on my previous project design, Coconut Maturity Checker. Initiated as a requisite for one of my subjects, this endeavor provided an invaluable learning experience. Although I couldn't complete the entire functionality due to some circumstance, the process enriched my understanding of various technologies. 

Throughout this project, I expanded my knowledge in:
<ul>
	<li>Python, HTML, and CSS</li>
	<li>Flask</li>
	<li>MongoDB</li>
	<li>API development</li>
</ul>
