# Coconut_Web_App

I developed a web application as part of my previous project and it was based on my previous project design, Coconut Maturity Checker. Initiated as a requisite for one of my subjects, this endeavor provided an invaluable learning experience. Although I couldn't complete the entire functionality due to changes in my project team and design topic, the process enriched my understanding of various technologies. Throughout this project, I expanded my knowledge in:
	\n Python, HTML, and CSS
	-Flask
	-MongoDB
	-API development
